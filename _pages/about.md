I am a Masters student at Stanford University studying [Computer Science](https://cs.stanford.edu). I am expecting to graduate in June 2021 with my master's and bachelor's degrees in Computer Science from Stanford University. My current research interests are in autonomous driving, multi-agent systems, and human-robotic interactions. I am also a member of Stanford [ILIAD](http://iliad.stanford.edu/), supervised by Professor [Dorsa Sadigh](https://dorsa.fyi/).
